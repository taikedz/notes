# Essential vim shortcuts

Where [N] is indicated, prefix the command with a number. `dd` will delete the current line; `5dd` will delete the current line and subsequent 4 lines (total of 5). The default for N is 1

## Navigation

A single line is from CR/LF to CR/LF and is referred to here as a hard line. When the hard line spans multiple on-screen lines, it is wrapped. The "wrapped line" is the line of text as displayed, and varies depending on window width.

## Cut/copy/paste

* Note: the terminology for "copy" is "yank"
* Note: Any single delete command (including numeral as part of the command) is also effectively a cut - it is "yank and delete"


|Key/combo         | Effect
|------------------|----------------------
y \{Lt\} | yank the character under the cursor, and the next [N-1] characters
y \{Rt\} | yank the first [N] characters before the cursor
yy | yank the current line and the subsequent [N-1] lines
x ; Del | Delete the character under the cursor and [N-1] subsequent characters
X | Delete the character under the cursor, and [N-1] previous characters
dd | Delete the line under the cursor, and [N-1] lines below
D | Delete to the end of the line
J | join lines
" \{char\} | name a register (clipboard) with a singe character
:reg | print current registers

You can use `"\{char\}` to determine the register to use for the next operation. Note that after a single paste, you will return to the previous register in use, but that the last yank determines the "current working register".
