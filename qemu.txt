qemu-img create myharddisk.qcow 5G
qemu-system-i386 -hda myhqrddisk.qcow -cdrom path/to.iso -boot d -m 1G -enable-kvm

Use alternatively any of the qemu-system-* emulators

Use -enable-kvm for KVM virtualization; this makes things MUCH faster - also mor stable for Windows to run???

You may find that the KVM attachment fails - this is typical if you have VirtualBox for example already running, or if it ran previously in your session. You need to log out and back in again (or perhaps even reboot?)
